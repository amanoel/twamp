# twamp

`twamp` (or `tvvamp`) is a Python implementation of the message-passing
algorithm introduced in [[arXiv:1809.06304]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06304).

## Setup

First make sure you have Python 3 in your computer -- the package is not
compatible with Python 2. For installing the package, go to the folder
where `setup.py` is located and type

```
pip install --user .
```

The necessary requirements should be automatically installed.

## Running

For a basic demo, you can try the `tomo.py` script inside the `examples`
folder.
